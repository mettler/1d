<p>This is an incomplete list of ideas that I’m actively looking to fund/help.</p> 
<br />
<p>Grid-scale energy storage</p>
<p>⁃ Storage costs for long duration energy storage need to beat LNG. We need new thermal, chemical, and mechanical ideas to get there. We also need better manufacturing yield for existing batteries. </p>
<p>⁃ Sell to industry: behind the meter is faster</p>
<br />
<p>Fusion</p>
<p>⁃ Underfunded concepts</p>
<p>⁃ Picks and shovels (making tritium with lithium or other methods, breeder blankets, etc.)</p>
<p>⁃ AI for better plasma control / stabilization</p>
<br />
<p>Fission</p>
<p>⁃ New reactor designs (safer and cheaper) https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-are-nuclear-power-construction</p>
<p>⁃ Tailwinds from IRA tax credits</p>
<p>⁃ Shorten the NRC approval process</p>
<br />
<p>Green fuel</p>
<p>⁃ Hydrocarbon or hydrogen synthesis using renewables</p>
<p>⁃ Cheap electrolyzers</p>
<br />
<p>Methane</p>
<p>⁃ Capture/removal for methane</p>
<br />
<p>Transmission expansion</p>
<p>⁃ new wires and transformers</p>
<p>⁃ Find a business model for utilities who can’t add rate base charges</p>
<br />
<p>CDR</p>
<p>- Basalt weathering to increase crop yield and decrease CO2: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2319436121?TOC_v121_i9= </p>
<br />
<p>Paper</p>
<p>⁃ Why do we still use trees? 13% of tropical deforestation is driven by demand for forestry products, mostly paper. Can we use bioengineering to make paper?</p>
<br />
<p>HVAC tech</p>
<p>- Non-compressor based designs (solid state, like elastocaloric)</p>
<p>⁃ Must fix some part of the distribution problem: voltage requirements, cost, footprint</p>
<br />
<p>Tiny electric trucks</p>
<p>⁃ I want one! </p>
<br />
<p>Not interesting</p>
<p>⁃ blockchain</p>
<p>⁃ direct to consumer</p>
