<p>Hi! I'm Mike Mettler (<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mettler" target="_blank">linkedin</a> & <a href="https://x.com/mettler" target="_blank">twitter/x</a>). I make angel investments (usually $25k) in great people building things that I want to see in the world, mostly in climate. I prefer to invest as early as possible, including being the first check. I like working directly with teams on product, sales, recruiting, and operations. I'm not as useful at the later growth stages.</p> 
<br />
<p>If you think I might be able to help, get in touch! Warm intros are best but not required.</p>
<br />
<p>Here is a partial list of areas that I'm actively looking to fund/help (this is not restrictive - if you're working on something else, great):</p> 
<br />
<p>Grid-scale energy storage</p>
<p>- New thermal, chemical, and mechanical storage with lower costs than gas</p>
<p>- Selling to industry behind the meter</p>
<p>- Existing battery plants need better manufacturing yield</p>
<br />
<p>Green fuel</p>
<p>- Hydrocarbon or hydrogen synthesis using renewables</p>
<p>- Companion technologies (e.g. electrolyzers)</p>
<br />
<p>Methane</p>
<p>- Capture/removal for methane</p>
<br />
<p>Fission</p>
<p>- New reactor designs that are safer, cheaper</p>
<p>- Tailwinds from IRA tax credits</p>
<p>- Speed up the NRC approval process</p>
<br />
<p>Fusion</p>
<p>- De-risked science that has not yet been picked up by a private company</p>
<p>- Picks and shovels (making tritium, breeder blankets, etc.)</p>
<p>- Software for better plasma control / stabilization</p>
<br />
<p>Transmission expansion</p>
<p>- New wires and transformers</p>
<p>- Find a business model for utilities who can't add rate base charges</p>
<br />
<p>Paper</p>
<p>- Why do we still use trees? Can we use bioengineering to make paper?</p>
<br />
<p>HVAC</p>
<p>- Non-compressor based designs (solid state, e.g. elastocaloric)</p>
<p>- Fix the distribution problem: voltage requirements, cost, footprint</p>
<br />
<p>Tiny electric trucks</p>
<p>- I want one!</p>
<br />
<p>Not interesting:</p>
<p>- blockchain</p>
<p>- direct to consumer</p>
<br />
<p>---------------------</p>
<br />
<p>What's 1d mean?</p>
<p>Dimension: when doing simulations, start with the simplest case</p>
<p>Temperature: We've already passed 1 degree C of warming, let's get back there!</p>
