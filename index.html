<p>Hi! I'm Mike Mettler (<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mettler" target="_blank">linkedin</a> & <a href="https://x.com/mettler" target="_blank">twitter/x</a>). I make angel investments (usually $25k) in great people building things that help our planet. I prefer to invest as early as possible, including being the first check. I like working directly with teams on product, sales, recruiting, and operations. I'm not as useful at the later growth stages.</p> 
<br />
<p>If you think I might be able to help, get in touch! Warm intros are best but not required.</p>
<br />
<p>Here is a partial list of areas that I'm actively looking to fund/help (this is not restrictive - if you're working on something else, great):</p> 
<br />
<p>Grid-scale energy storage</p>
<p>- New thermal, chemical, and mechanical storage ideas</p>
<p>- Improving yield and lowering costs for existing batteries</p>
<br />
<p>Green fuel</p>
<p>- Hydrocarbon or hydrogen synthesis using renewables</p>
<p>- Companion technologies (e.g. electrolyzers)</p>
<br />
<p>Methane</p>
<p>- Capture/removal for methane</p>
<p>- Microbiome approaches to preventing cow methanogenesis</p>
<br />
<p>Fission</p>
<p>- New approaches that are safer, cheaper, or faster to build/approve</p>
<br />
<p>Fusion</p>
<p>- De-risked concepts that have not yet made it out of a lab</p>
<p>- Software for better plasma control / stabilization</p>
<p>- Picks and shovels (making tritium, breeder blankets, etc.)</p>
<br />
<p>Efficient computing</p>
<p>- Low power hardware for AI/ML</p>
<br />
<p>Water</p>
<p>- Water from seawater (desalination)</p>
<p>- Water from air</p>  
<br />
<p>Paper</p>
<p>- Why do we still use trees? Can we use bioengineering?</p>
<br />
<p>Heat pumps</p>
<p>- Non-compressor based designs (solid state, e.g. elastocaloric)</p>
<br />
